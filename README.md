# Optical Character recognition
This is a simple OCR Web App using tesseract, an open source OCR engine.
<br>
In this app, it was used the "pytesseract" pyton library to handle the text recognition. 
<br>
<br>
Contains:
- ES6+ JavaScript
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- Bootstrap CSS
- Tesseract
- Python (with a child-process)

# How does it works?
<br>
The user simply uploads an image using the file uploader, and clicks upload,
all the read text will show up in the output column.
